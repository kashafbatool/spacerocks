# SpaceRocks 🚀

**SpaceRocks** is a classic 2D arcade space shooter built in **GameMaker**, inspired by retro asteroid games where quick reflexes and smooth controls are everything.

Destroy incoming space rocks, master your ship’s movement, and survive as long as you can — all while learning the fundamentals of game mechanics, physics, and input handling in a real project.
